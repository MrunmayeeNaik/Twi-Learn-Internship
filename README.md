# Twi-Learn-Internship
I completed a 2-month virtual internship at TwiLearn where I gained hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization. 
The internship was in 2 phases : 
* Training Period (1st month) : There were virtual training sessions where I learnt skills like Data Understanding Lifecycle , Python , SQL , PowerBI.
* Projects (2nd month) : Worked on two projects namely - **HR Data Analytics** and **Zomato Data Analysis**.

## Project 1: HR Analytics Dashboard
**Objective**: Develop an interactive HR dashboard to provide insights into employee performance, engagement, and turnover rates.

**Key Features**:
* Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and standardized employee data in Google Sheets.
* Data Transformation: Used Power BI's query editor for transformations like creating conditional columns.
* Dashboard Creation: Visualized metrics such as performance ratings, turnover by job role, and engagement trends.

**Tools Used**:
* Google Sheets (for data cleaning)
* Power BI (for data transformation and dashboard development)

## Project 2: Zomato Data Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze Zomato's restaurant data to understand customer preferences, restaurant performance, and market trends.

**Key Features**:
* Data Cleaning: Extracted numerical ratings from the "rate" column using Python.
* Exploratory Analysis: Answered business questions, such as:
  1. What type of restaurants do customers prefer?
  2. What are the most common ratings?
  3. Which mode (online/offline) has received maximum ratings?
     
* Visualizations: Created visualizations (countplots, histograms, heatmaps) to showcase insights.
  
**Tools Used**:
* Python (pandas, NumPy)
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
